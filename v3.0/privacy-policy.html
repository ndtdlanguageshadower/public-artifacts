      <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>
        NDTD Language Shadower operates primarily on your device. Your media files, recordings,
        bookmarks, and notes are stored locally and are never sent to our servers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Auto Generate: When you use this feature, the app sends the topic you select (e.g.,
        "job interview"), an App Attest assertion, and device security signals to our backend
        to generate audio.
      </p>
      <p>
        We do not collect your name, email, contacts, photos, or precise location, and we do
        not use third‑party analytics or advertising.
      </p>
      <p>
        For security and purchase verification, we may process: App Attest key ID, App Attest receipt
        and risk metric, purchase transaction claim IDs, and IP address for rate limiting.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
      <p>We use App Attest signals to prevent abuse and enforce free‑use limits for Auto Generate.</p>
      <p>We use purchase transaction claim IDs to verify paid generations.</p>
      <p>We use IP address for rate limiting and service protection.</p>
      <p>
        Imported files, voice recordings, bookmarks, scan results, and study notes remain on your
        device for your personal language learning practice.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Data Storage</h2>
      <p>
        All data—imported media, voice recordings, bookmarks, notes, and scan-generated audio—is
        stored locally using iOS storage (UserDefaults, Documents directory, Keychain).
      </p>
      <p>
        Google Drive and OneDrive: If you connect these accounts, OAuth tokens are stored securely
        in your device Keychain. We do not receive or store these tokens on our servers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Backend storage (limited): App Attest key ID, App Attest receipt and risk metric, and purchase
        transaction claim IDs are stored to prevent fraud and verify purchases.
      </p>
      <p>
        Data retention: We retain security and transaction records only as long as needed for
        fraud prevention, accounting, and legal requirements. You may request deletion by contacting us.
      </p>
    </div>

      <h2>Data Flow Diagram (Simplified)</h2>
      <pre>
You
 └─ App (on device)
     ├─ Local files/recordings/notes (stay on device)
     ├─ OAuth to Google/Microsoft (direct, tokens stored in Keychain)
     └─ Auto Generate request
         ├─ Topic ID + App Attest assertion → Backend
         ├─ Backend → Service provider (script + audio generation)
         └─ Backend → App (audio + optional subtitles)

Backend stores (limited):
- App Attest key ID + receipt + risk metric
- Purchase transaction claim ID
- Rate-limit counters (may include IP)
      </pre>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Permissions</h2>
      <p>• Microphone: Used only to record your voice practice sessions. Recordings are stored locally.</p>
      <p>• File Access: Used to import media and subtitle files from your device or cloud providers for local playback.</p>
      <p>• Camera: Used only when you use Scan to capture book pages. Images are processed on your device (OCR and speech synthesis); they are not sent to our servers.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>This app does not use third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking.</p>
      <p>
        URLs &amp; Cloud: The app connects to user-provided URLs (Google Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox, or
        direct links) when you stream or download. For Google Drive and OneDrive sign-in, the app
        uses OAuth and connects directly to Google/Microsoft—we do not receive your credentials or
        file content.
      </p>
      <p>
        Auto Generate: Uses our backend service to produce audio from the topic you select. We may
        process limited security signals (App Attest) and purchase transaction IDs.
      </p>
      <p>Our backend uses third-party service providers to generate scripts and speech audio based on your selected topic.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        Our app does not knowingly collect any information from children. Since we do not collect any
        personal information, this policy applies to all users regardless of age.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by
        posting the new Privacy Policy and updating the "Last Updated" date.
      </p>
