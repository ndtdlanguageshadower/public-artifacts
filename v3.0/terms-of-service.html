    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <div class="meta">Version: 3.0 &middot; Last Updated: February 23, 2026</div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Acceptance of Terms</h2>
      <p>
        By downloading, installing, or using NDTD Language Shadower ("the App"), you agree to these
        Terms of Service. If you do not agree, do not use the App.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>What This App Does</h2>
      <p>NDTD Language Shadower is a language shadowing player and practice tool. You can:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Import media (video, audio, subtitles) from your device, Google Drive, OneDrive, or URLs</li>
        <li>Scan book pages with the camera to create audio with subtitles</li>
        <li>Use auto-generated audio from predefined topics for listening practice</li>
        <li>Optionally record a karaoke-style shadow session (screen + microphone) for sharing</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The App does not provide copyrighted content. For URLs and cloud links, the App retrieves
        the file you request. Auto-generated content is provided for personal learning use.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Content Rights</h2>
      <p>You may only import, download, or stream media and subtitles that you:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>own,</li>
        <li>are licensed to use, or</li>
        <li>are otherwise legally permitted to access.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This applies to content from your device, cloud storage (Google Drive, OneDrive), URLs, or
        material you scan with the camera.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>In-App Purchases</h2>
      <p>
        The App may offer optional in-app purchases (consumables), such as purchasing one additional
        Auto Generate, enabling one-time recording mode, or leaving an optional tip. These purchases
        are processed by Apple via the App Store. We do not store your payment card details.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tips are optional and do not unlock content or features.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>License to Use; No Ownership</h2>
      <p>
        Audio and other content provided through the App—including auto-generated audio and any content
        you paid to access—is licensed to you, not sold. You have the right to use, share, and keep it
        for your personal learning use, but you do not own it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unless we agree otherwise in writing, we may require you to delete any such content (e.g., audio
        or files you obtained through the App) from your devices and storage if we ask you to. You agree
        to comply with such a request within a reasonable time.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Your Responsibility</h2>
      <p>
        You are responsible for ensuring your use of any media and subtitles complies with applicable laws
        and the terms of the source (e.g., website or cloud storage provider).
      </p>
      <p>When using Scan: only scan materials you own or have permission to use.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>No Legal Advice</h2>
      <p>
        This App does not provide legal advice. If you are unsure whether you have rights to use certain
        content, do not import or stream it.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
      <p>
        The App and any auto-generated or other content are provided "as is" without warranties of any kind.
        We do not guarantee uninterrupted or error-free service.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>
        To the fullest extent permitted by law, we are not liable for any indirect, incidental, special, or
        consequential damages arising from your use of the App or any content.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Changes to These Terms</h2>
      <p>
        We may update these Terms from time to time. We will notify you of material changes by posting the new
        Terms and updating the "Last Updated" date. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance
        of the updated Terms.
      </p>
